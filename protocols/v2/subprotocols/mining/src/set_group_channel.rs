/// # SetGroupChannel (Server -> Client)
///
/// Every standard channel is a member of a group of standard channels, addressed by the
/// upstream server’s provided identifier. The group channel is used mainly for efficient job
/// distribution to multiple standard channels at once.
/// If we want to allow different jobs to be served to different standard channels (e.g. because of
/// different BIP 8 version bits) and still be able to distribute the work by sending
/// NewExtendendedMiningJob instead of a repeated NewMiningJob, we need a more
/// fine-grained grouping for standard channels.
/// This message associates a set of standard channels with a group channel. A channel (identified
/// by particular ID) becomes a group channel when it is used by this message as
/// group_channel_id. The server MUST ensure that a group channel has a unique channel ID
/// within one connection. Channel reinterpretation is not allowed.
/// This message can be sent only to connections that don’t have REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS
/// flag in SetupConnection.
