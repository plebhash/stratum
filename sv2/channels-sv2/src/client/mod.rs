//! Sv2 channels - Mining Clients Abstractions.
//!
//! The `client` module is compatible with `no_std` environments. To enable this mode, build the
//! crate with the `no_std` feature. In this configuration, standard library collections are
//! replaced with the `hashbrown` crate, together with `core` and `alloc`, allowing the module to be
//! used in embedded or constrained contexts.

/// [`InvalidJobId`](crate::client::share_accounting::ShareValidationError::InvalidJobId) — a
/// bounded loss of creditable work, the price of bounding memory under a hostile upstream, which

///
/// Matches the server-side default, so a proxy never evicts a job its upstream still accepts.
/// Retaining more than the upstream gains nothing: the proxy credits the share locally and the
/// upstream rejects it anyway.

/// The cap is a retention *window* — `cap / job rate` — and here the upstream sets the rate.
/// Measurement bounded the requirement at ~16 s (PR #2307), so 16 covers the fastest configurable
/// rate of one job per second. Operators who know their upstream's interval `T` should set
/// `ceil(16 s / T)` and reclaim the memory, at ~4.5 kB per retained job per channel (PR #2290).
/// That matters most on a translator, where every downstream miner holds its own client channel;
/// on a job-declaration client the interval is its own `SetCustomMiningJob` rate.

/// upstream advertising a trivial target can drive the cache to it at message speed.
///
/// A client cache does not need to hold a whole chain tip's worth of shares. It exists to catch
/// a share source re-submitting work it already sent — a retransmit or a buggy loop, which

/// typical 6 shares/min channel and ~7 minutes for a very busy 600 shares/min proxy channel,
/// far beyond any realistic duplicate window in both cases. Overflow evicts oldest-first, and
/// an evicted-then-replayed hash costs one double-counted local statistic: an accepted replay
/// window, see [`ShareAccounting`](share_accounting::ShareAccounting) for why clients do not
/// fail hard at the bound.
