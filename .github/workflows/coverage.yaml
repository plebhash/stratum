# Performs test coverage of project's libraries using cargo-tarpaulin and the message-generator,
# and generates results using codecov.io.
# The following flags are set inside `tarpaulin.toml`:
# `features = "..."`: Includes the code with the listed features. The following features result in a
#     tarpaulin error and are NOT included: derive, alloc, arbitrary-derive, attributes, and
#     with_serde
# `run-types = [ "Lib" ]`: Only tests the package's library unit tests. Includes protocols, and utils (without the
#     exclude-files flag, it includes this example because it contains a lib.rs file)
# `exclude-files = [ "examples/*" ]`: Excludes all projects in examples directory (specifically added to
#     ignore examples that that contain a lib.rs file like interop-cpp)
# `timeout = "120s"`: If unresponsive for 120 seconds, action will fail
# `fail-under = 20`: If code coverage is less than 20%, action will fail
# `out = ["Xml"]`: Required for codecov.io to generate coverage result
# All message-generator test flags are in tests in test/message-generator/test
# This test loops through every test in test/message-generator/test, and runs each one, collecting
# code coverage data for anything in the roles/ directory that is relevant to SV2(pool, mining-proxy)
